# Text-Classification
Using ML and NLP techniques, we conducted text classification in this notebook to identify relevant reviews from a book review dataset. Kindly note that we trained our ML model using a sample dataset consisting of the first 30 reviews from three books. During the exercise, we developed two models: a semi-supervised SelfTrainingClassifier and a supervised SVC.

# Goodreads-Review-Webscraping-and-Text-Analysis

The project takes webscraped data from https://www.goodreads.com/ to create a dataset for the purpose of building a spam review filtering model and analytical visualizations in a graph database.

The dataset stems from the Top 100 books picked by Times magazine on goodreads.com (https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/2681.Time_Magazine_s_All_Time_100_Novels).
